# you-draw-it

-Work in progress-

Slightly adopted the you-draw-it implementation from the great work at https://github.com/wdr-data/you-draw-it. Original idea developed by [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html).
